Homework Assignment: Golang Basics
Project Title: String Analysis
In this homework assignment, you will create a Golang program that performs various string operations and uses variables, if-else conditions, constants,
and IOTA.
Task 1: Variable Declaration and String Operations
1. Declare three string variables with the following names: str1 , str2 , and str3 . Assign any three different strings of your choice to these variables.
2. Write a function called stringLength that takes a string as input and returns the length of the string using the Rune count. Use this function to find
and print the lengths of str1 , str2 , and str3 .
Task 2: If-Else Conditions
1. Create a function called compareStrings that takes two string arguments and compares their lengths using if-else conditions. The function should
print a message saying which string is longer or if they are of equal length.
Task 3: Constants and IOTA
1. Declare a constant named MaxStringLength with a value of 10.
2. Create an enumeration using IOTA for the following weekdays: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Assign each
day a value starting from 1.
3. Write a function called printDay that takes a day as an argument (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) and prints the corresponding value of the day.

Console Output (Expected)
After implementing the above tasks, running the program should produce the following output: Test your program thoroughly and ensure that it produces the expected output.

--- Task 1: Variable Declaration and String Operations ---
Length of str1: 7
Length of str2: 12
Length of str3: 15

--- Task 2: If-Else Conditions ---
str1 is shorter than str2.
str2 is longer than str3.
str3 and str1 are of equal length.

--- Task 3: Constants and IOTA ---
Max String Length: 10

--- Days of the Week ---
Monday: 1
Tuesday: 2
Wednesday: 3
Thursday: 4
Friday: 5
Saturday: 6
Sunday: 7
